# Features to Add

Here are a collection of features to add based on user recommendations:

1.  Have a means of restarting the game *but* refreshing it (i.e., when the game ends, have a button that the user can press to restart the game)
1.  The "easy" difficulty could just be matching pictures with pictures.
    - e.g., If the user cannot read, it won't be that easy for them.
1.  Have an explanation *somewhere* in the game on the game's difficulties.

# Current progress...

1.  A restart menu has been added.  However, the buttons on the new menu cannot be clicked.
    - As of now, the code hides and re-displays the buttons.  Perhaps something can be done to "un-click" the button via JS.
1.  The easy difficulty has been implemented.
1.  The explanation still needs work.
    - I've done up explanations already, but they still look a little ugly.  Perhaps use something else instead?

1. What the heck do I put for hard difficulty?
1. Make sure that the pictures and the words match!
1. Should I add a start menu?
